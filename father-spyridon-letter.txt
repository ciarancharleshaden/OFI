Dear Fr. Spiridon,

We hope this message finds you well. This is a message from the organisers of the Orthodox Fellowship in Ireland (OFI). We are writing to inform you about this initiative and to invite you to participate in our upcoming conference taking place on September 28th 2024 in the Romanian Mission Centre in Dublin.

The OFI is a Pan-Orthodox initiative aimed at fellowship and spiritual growth for Orthodox believers, catechumens, and enquirers all around Ireland (both ROI and NI). This initiative started with the blessing and collaboration of the clergy from the Russian Church as well as the Romanian Church back in August 2023. Being a young fellowship, and the first of its kind in Ireland, we work on simultaneous initiatives, those being:

- Monthly gatherings for worship and fellowship (held in different churches around Ireland)
- A ⁠cinema club where we watch and discuss Orthodox/spiritual movies
- ⁠Irish Saints workshop where people do presentations about various Irish Saints, after clergy review

In addition to these initiatives, we are organising a conference on the 28th of September 2024 with the title “On Earth as it is in Heaven - Orthodoxy Today”, held in the Romanian Mission Centre in Drimnagh, Dublin. Would you be interested in coming as a speaker in this conference? It would be a great joy and a blessing if you would join us. Please let us know if you are interested by the 5th of July.

Here are the links to our social media channels. Facebook and Instagram contain media about our fellowship activities and YouTube contains videos from the Irish Saints workshop.
